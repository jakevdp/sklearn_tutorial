    "[Scikit-Learn](http://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) is a Python package designed to give access to **well-known** machine learning algorithms within Python code, through a **clean, well-thought-out API**. It has been built by hundreds of contributors from around the world, and is used across industry and academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn is built upon Python's [NumPy (Numerical Python)](http://numpy.org) and [SciPy (Scientific Python)](http://scipy.org) libraries, which enable efficient in-core numerical and scientific computation within Python. As such, scikit-learn is not specifically designed for extremely large datasets, though there is [some work](https://github.com/ogrisel/parallel_ml_tutorial) in this area.\n",

    "like a database system would do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take a look at two very simple machine learning tasks here.\n",
    "The first is a **classification** task: the figure shows a\n",
